        <p class="x-bein-tilvitnun">Grimoires began simply as quick-reference “grammar books” for sorcerers, magicians, and priests before evolving into comprehensive guides to magic, com&#173;plete with spell-casting rituals, magical alphabets, and in&#173;structions to create amulets and talismans. With the advent of the printing press, some grimoires were mass produced, but many of the abbreviations were mis&#173;inter&#173;preted and magical words misspelled, rendering them ineffective. The most powerful grimoires remained not only secret but also heavily encoded, making them accessible only to the highest initiates of the magical traditions.</p>

        <p class="Meginmal">Bjarni H. Þórarinsson (b.1947) is an Icelandic artist who lives and works in downtown Reykjavík (2015). He was educated in the late seventies at The Ice&#173;landic College of Art &amp; Craft in the spirit of Fluxus and Conceptual Arts. In 1988 his ways of thinking changed dramatically. He experi&#173;enced a vision. He went behind the mirror. From there he slowly and painstakingly started to develop his grimoires. He started with a DOT and LINE – pretty basic.<span class="char-style-override-15">Mynd 1</span> Note that his research into his own world happened after his visual experience, enlightenment. His vision did not appear be&#173;cause of research activity. That was also the case with Newton and Einstein. Ofcourse things happen while researching but rarely the most important things.</p>

        <p class="Meginmal">From there Þórarinsson went on and gave the items in his grimoires original names. This became more or less fully formed in the early nineties. In june 1993 he exhibited his visio-logy, visio-art, visio-ism, visio&#173;philosophy, visio acad&#173;emy at Boekie Woekie Gallery then at Berenstraat 16 in Amsterdam. In small print-out art philosopher Gunnar J. Árnason wrote: Visio-art is what Bjarni H. Þórarins&#173;son calls his drawings, that should more appropriately be viewed as diagrams. The drawings are metaphysical in spirit and artistic in expression.</p>
        <p class="Meginmal">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Meginmal">Visio-ism, visio-logy, visio-manuscripts are terms Þórar&#173;ins&#173;son uses as names for his new science. Typi&#173;cally for him, visio-plays on three different asso&#173;ciations, “Vision” in english and the Icelandic word “Vísi” for wisdom, and to point or give directions.</p>
        <p class="Meginmal">&#160;</p>
        <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="image/timarit/bjarni%20first%20rose%202_opt.jpeg"><img class="frame-20 floatLeft" src="image/timarit/bjarni%20first%20rose%202_opt.jpeg" alt="bjarni%20first%20rose%202.jpg" /></a>
        <p class="Meginmal">Þórarinsson has used the Icelandic word “Benda” to express the basic insight behind his vision of the world. “Benda” might be translated as “pointer”, at least it captures the main drift of the fundamental principle that every existence in the universe depends on relations of one sort or another. The whole of Þórarinsson’s visiological output is an examination of and variation on this theme. The various aspects of all relations fall into five basic categories; material, essen&#173;tial, formal, process and <span>modal relations. These</span> re&#173;la&#173;tions may combine with each other in endless ways depending on the par&#173;ticu&#173;lars of each case. Thus this formula for the universe can be paraphrased; existence is a function of five relations of infinite variability.</p>
        <p class="Meginmal">&#160;</p>
        
        <p class="Meginmal para-style-override-16"><span>Þórarinsson’s metaphysi&#173;cal art affirms an age old philo&#173;sophic conviction, not much in favor at the present within the academic com&#173;mun&#173;ity, that the structure of language is isomorphic or corresponding with the struc&#173;ture of real&#173;ity. His dia&#173;grams don’t tell us anything of any practical conse&#173;quence, but they are meant to give us a sense of the tot&#173;ality and unity of exist&#173;ence. His “language-keys” are play on patterns and words, but to his mind they also give us a glimpse of the order of things. Each key consists of two to three letters usually placed in the centre of a circular rosette pattern. The pattern itself is like a bloss&#173;om where each petal is an Icelandic word (both real and imaginary) that contains the germinal string of letters. The result is a simple rhyme. The pattern of the rosette and the rhyme of words give us perceptual and semantic sense of the rhyme of exist&#173;ence. Which is just another expression of the interre&#173;latedness (binding) of all existentia.</span><span></span></p>

        <p class="Meginmal">All the original rosettes and the grimoires are done with hard pencil on A4 sheets. The first ones were though done with felt pen until the <span>artist realized that the pig&#173;</span>ment vanished. The visio-rosettes started to appear winter 1990–91 and are still being done (2015). The first 23 years they were all drawn in coffe houses and bars in Reykjavik down&#173;town. First at BAR22 (has different name now) on the corner of Lauga&#173;vegur and Klappar&#173;stígur, Then at Kaffi List on Klapparstígur 26 (Hotel now), Then at Grand Rokk on Klapparstígur 30 (that house later became CIRKUS. The house has been demolished now, The Grand Rokk Moved and Þórarinsson with it to Smiðju&#173;stígur but during the moving process some were <span>done at Café Dillon on Lauga&#173;</span>vegur (still exists) and then Næsti Bar on Ingólfsstræti.</p>
